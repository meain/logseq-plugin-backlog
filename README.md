# Logseq Refile

A LogSeq plugin to refile items in your graph.

The plugin provides two commands. They can be invoked using slash (`/`) or using keyboard shortcuts.

- `Refile Completed`: Refile all the top level items with `DONE` or `CANCELED` marker (default keyboard shortcut: `r c`)
- `Refile Item`: Refile the current item (default keyboard shortcut: `r i`)

By default, the location to which items are refiled to is `<page-name>/Complete`, but you can change that by adding a page properly `REFILE-LOCATION` with the name of the page to which you want to refile it to.

## Example usecase

I primarily see two usecases for this:

1) Refilling completed items from a backlog as shown in the video below

[logseq-plugin-backlog.webm](https://github.com/meain/logseq-plugin-backlog/assets/14259816/81d06c60-6fd7-470b-8e7d-9781cf78ac01)

2) Managing lists like `to/watch` where to add in movies, series, books etc and refile them once complete to another page.
